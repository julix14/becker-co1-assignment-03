## Assignment 3

## Winter Semester 2022/2023

Prof. Dr. Mohammed AbuJarour


## 1. Overview

In the context of this assignment, you will create a simple Java application that allows a user to manage a list of
their friends.
The application should have the following features:

1. The user should be able to add a new friend to the list, including their name and phone
    number.
2. The user should be able to view the entire list of friends.
3. The user should be able to search for a friend by name (might return many friends).
4. The user should be able to delete a friend from the list.

To complete this assignment, you will need to use the following Java concepts:

1. Java files: You will need to use a file to store the list of friends.
2. Java collections: You will need to use a collection to store the list of friends.
3. GUI: You will need to create a simple GUI for the user to interact with the application.

## 2. Requirements

1. Import the provided Java project in your Eclipse IDE and rename it as indicated below.
2. [ 2 points] Create the necessary Java classes with the necessary attributes and methods
3. [1 point] Create a class called FriendApp with a main method that serves as the entry
    point for the application.
4. [7 points] Create a simple GUI for the application. The GUI should have the following
    features:
       a. A list view showing all friends from the text file (i.e., after initializing the app)
       b. A text field for the user to enter the name of a friend to search for
       c. A button to search for a friend by name (the list should be updated accordingly)
       d. A text field for the user to enter the name of a new friend
       e. A text field for the user to enter the phone number of a new friend
       f. A button to add the new friend to the list (the list should be updated accordingly)
       g. A button to delete a selected friend from the list
5. [ 4 points] Before leaving the app, ask the user whether the made changes need to be
    saved or not. If the user selects to save the changes, all modifications (e.g., deletions and
    additions) have to be persisted in the text file. Ensure all names are sorted alphabetically
    before storing them in the file.


## 3. Hints

- Assignment deadline: 22. 01 .202 3 23:59 CEST. No late submissions.
- This is individual work. Your code will be checked for plagiarism.
- Split your code into methods and classes to make it modular
- Submit your code as an Eclipse project
- All project artifacts have to be encoded in UTF- 8
- Export your Eclipse project as a single archive (.zip) and upload it through Teams
- Use this naming scheme for your project AND archive file: Lastname-co1-assignment- 03 , where Lastname is replaced by your actual last name.
- Pay attention to the quality of your code, e.g., following the conventions and using expressive names of methods and variables, etc.
- [1 point] Code quality and software design will have an impact on the overall assessment, i.e., “it works” is not sufficient.
